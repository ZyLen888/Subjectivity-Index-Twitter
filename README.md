## âœ… Predicting Peopleâ€™s Subjectivity Using Their Posts On Twitter

The aim of this project is to determine the subjectivity of a tweet.  

Objective information is factual information whereas subjective information is biased on the basis of the conveyorâ€™s own opinions, prejudices and emotions about the topic at hand.

The ability to discern between objective and subjective tweets could be paramount to making a distinction between real and fake information being consumed by the general population. Subjectivity detection can be used by governmental agencies to find out which topics are polarizing the public so they can intervene early and attempt to prevent public discourse and further polarization. Similarly, businesses can benefit by keeping an ear out for opinionated posts to understand which of their products and/or services are causing a stir in the public domain and utilize the feedback constructively.
